    import {Outlet} from "react-router-dom":
This line is an ES6 module import statement. It allows you to bring in specific parts (such as functions, classes, or components) from an external module (in this case, the "react-router-dom" package).

(React Router, routes define the mapping between URL patterns and the corresponding React components to render. They serve as the backbone of client-side navigation in single-page applications (SPAs), allowing users to navigate between different views without full-page reloads.
Definition:
A route represents a specific URL path within your application.
It associates a URL pattern (such as /teams/:teamId) with a React component (e.g., Team).
When the user navigates to a specific URL, the corresponding component is rendered)

<Outlet> Component:
The <Outlet> component is part of the React Router library.
It should be used within a parent route element to render its child route elements.
When a parent route matches the current URL, the <Outlet> component renders the corresponding child route(s).
Essentially, it acts as a placeholder for nested UI content within the parent route.

You can think of it as a way to dynamically render different components based on the current route.
Example Usage:
Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a parent route called Dashboard:
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    //{ This element will render either <DashboardMessages> when the URL is "/messages",
    //   <DashboardTasks> at "/tasks", or null if it is "/" }
          <Outlet />
          </div>
        );
      }
      
      In this example:
      The Dashboard component renders an <Outlet> where child routes will be displayed.
      Depending on the URL, it will render either DashboardMessages or DashboardTasks components (assuming those are defined as child routes).
      Nested Routes and UI Composition:
      The <Outlet> component is particularly useful when you have nested routes within your application.
      It allows you to compose your UI by breaking it down into smaller components that correspond to different routes.
      You can define child routes within the parent route and use the <Outlet> to render them dynamically.
